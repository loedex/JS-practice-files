# JavaScript Practice Files

This repository contains all my JavaScript learning practice files.  
Every file represents a specific topic that I am learning step by step — from basics to advanced concepts.

## What this repo includes:
- Introduction to JavaScript  
- Variables and Data Types  
- Operators and Expressions  
- Conditional Structures  
- Loops  
- Functions  
- (More topics coming soon)

I am using this repository to practice JavaScript and Git commands together.
